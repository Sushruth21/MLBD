        "The EM algorithm is an iterative method used for finding maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models where some of the data is missing or unobserved, or when there are latent (unobserved) variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Coin Flipping Model:***\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem statement involves a model where we have two coins, A and B, each with its own bias (probability of landing heads). The task is to estimate the biases of these coins given a series of coin flip outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Expectation Step (E-step):***\n",
        "\n",
        "In the E-step, we compute the expected value for heads_A, tails_A, heads_B, and tails_B over the observed coin flip outcomes, given the current estimates of the biases of coins A and B. We use the current model parameters to compute the likelihood of each outcome being generated by each coin and then use Bayes' rule to compute the expected number of heads and tails for each coin.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Maximization Step (M-step):***\n",
        "\n",
        "In the M-step, we update the parameters (biases) of the coins based on the expected number of heads and tails computed in the E-step. We calculate new estimates for the biases of coins A and B that maximize the likelihood of the observed coin flip outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Iterative Process:***\n",
        "\n",
        "The E-step and M-step are iterated alternately until convergence. In each iteration, the E-step computes the expected values of the missing data (latent variables), and the M-step updates the parameters based on these expected values. The process continues until the parameters stabilize, and the likelihood of the observed data reaches a local maximum.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Likelihood Function:***\n",
        "\n",
        "The likelihood function in this context represents the probability of observing the given coin flip outcomes given the biases of the coins. It is computed using the binomial distribution, which models the probability of obtaining a certain number of heads (or tails) in a series of coin flips.\n"
